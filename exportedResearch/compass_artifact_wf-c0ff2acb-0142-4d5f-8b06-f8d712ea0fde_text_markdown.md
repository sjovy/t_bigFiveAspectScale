# BFAS Interpretation Database: A Complete Guide for AI-Based Personality Assessment

The Big Five Aspect Scale provides clinically and practically superior personality measurement by dividing each Big Five domain into two distinct aspects with separate biological substrates, differential validity for outcomes, and unique behavioral signatures. This database synthesizes research to enable precise, actionable score interpretation.

---

## Foundational framework: Why aspects matter more than domains

Colin DeYoung, Lena Quilty, and Jordan Peterson developed the BFAS in 2007 after behavior-genetic studies revealed **two distinct genetic factors** underlying facets within each Big Five domain. This intermediate level between facets and domains captures meaningful personality variance that domain-level measurement obscures.

The 10 aspects form a hierarchy: at the top sit two metatraits—**Stability** (Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) linked to serotonin, and **Plasticity** (Extraversion, Openness/Intellect) linked to dopamine. Below these, the Big Five domains split into aspect pairs with correlations ranging from r = .51 to .64, allowing significant divergence within individuals.

**Key finding establishing aspect value**: In well-being research, one aspect within each domain drove associations while its partner showed near-zero relationships: Enthusiasm (sr = .41) versus Assertiveness (sr = .14); Withdrawal (sr = -.42) versus Volatility (sr = -.03); Industriousness (sr = .55) versus Orderliness (sr = -.14). Domain scores would have masked these differential patterns entirely.

## NEUROTICISM DOMAIN

### Volatility: Active defensive reactions

**What high Volatility means for behavior**

High scorers experience rapid emotional shifts, irritability, and difficulty controlling impulses when frustrated. They get angry easily, are sensitive to environmental stimuli, and approach threatening situations with active defensive responses rather than withdrawal. The underlying mechanism involves the **Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS)**, governed by the hypothalamus and brainstem.

**Behavioral correlates for high Volatility (above 75th percentile)**:
- Mood swings and emotional lability in daily life
- Reactive anger in response to frustration or perceived slights
- Difficulty maintaining composure under stress
- Interpersonal conflict driven by emotional reactivity
- Sleep disturbance through anger, conflict, and impulse control problems

**Career and workplace outcomes**:
- Under high task demands, additional effort investment leads to **worse** performance for high-Volatility individuals
- Associated with counterproductive work behaviors and interpersonal deviance
- Red flag for leadership roles requiring emotional regulation
- May create stress in team members, especially those high in Withdrawal

**Clinical associations (well-established)**:
- Predicts **externalizing** symptoms: delusions (p = .004), agitation/aggression (p < .001), irritability (p = .037)
- Associated with bipolar disorder risk specifically
- High Volatility + Low Withdrawal pattern = elevated hypomania risk
- Distinguished from Withdrawal: external expression versus internal experience of negative affect

**Interpretation template for high Volatility (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your score suggests you experience emotions intensely and may find yourself reacting quickly to frustrating situations. This emotional responsiveness can be valuable for detecting problems early and motivating action, but may sometimes lead to reactions you later regret. Developing strategies for pausing before responding—especially in interpersonal situations—could help channel this intensity productively."

---

### Withdrawal: Passive avoidance and behavioral inhibition

**What high Withdrawal means for behavior**

High scorers experience frequent worry, self-doubt, and susceptibility to anxiety and depression. They feel easily threatened, have intrusive negative thoughts, and tend toward rumination. The mechanism involves the **Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS)**, with the hippocampus and amygdala as central nodes, producing passive avoidance in response to uncertainty.

**Behavioral correlates for high Withdrawal (above 75th percentile)**:
- Frequent worry about future events and potential problems
- Pessimistic outlook and self-doubt
- Avoidance of situations perceived as threatening
- Difficulty with uncertainty and ambiguous situations
- Rumination and difficulty "letting go" of negative thoughts

**Academic and work outcomes**:
- Under high task demands, additional effort investment leads to **better** performance (anxiety channeled productively)
- May avoid challenging assignments or leadership opportunities
- Predicts lower job satisfaction through stress spillover

**Clinical associations (well-established)**:
- Predicts **internalizing** symptoms: anxiety (p = .001), depression (p = .002)
- Represents shared risk factor for anxiety and mood disorders ("Distress" factor)
- Strongest predictor of sleep problems through loneliness, depression, and rumination
- Three-way interaction: Withdrawal × low Industriousness × low Enthusiasm = highest depression risk

**Interpretation template for high Withdrawal (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your score indicates a tendency toward worry and sensitivity to potential threats. While this vigilance can help you anticipate problems and prepare carefully, it may also lead to unnecessary anxiety or avoidance of opportunities. The good news: research shows that people high in Withdrawal often perform well under pressure when they direct their heightened arousal toward the task. Recognizing when worry is protective versus excessive is key."

---

### Interpreting Volatility versus Withdrawal asymmetries

**High Volatility + Low Withdrawal**:
- Emotionally reactive without depression/anxiety
- Expresses negative affect outward (anger, irritability)
- When combined with high Assertiveness: elevated hypomania risk
- More harmful in interpersonal contexts; may create hostile environments
- Clinical consideration: Screen for bipolar spectrum

**High Withdrawal + Low Volatility**:
- Depression and anxiety without emotional outbursts
- Internalized distress, behavioral inhibition
- More responsive to effort allocation strategies
- Clinical consideration: Screen for unipolar depression, anxiety disorders

---

## AGREEABLENESS DOMAIN

### Compassion: Emotional empathy and concern for others

**What high Compassion means for behavior**

High scorers feel others' emotions deeply, show genuine concern for others' welfare, and are motivated to help those in need. The mechanism involves relatively automatic emotional processes including empathy and caring, linked to oxytocin and social bonding systems.

**Behavioral correlates for high Compassion (above 75th percentile)**:
- Strong empathic responses to others' distress
- Active helping behavior and altruism
- Emotional warmth in relationships
- Interest in others' feelings and well-being
- May be moved to tears by others' suffering

**Career and workplace outcomes**:
- Optimal for healthcare, counseling, social work, HR roles
- Predicts organizational citizenship behaviors (helping colleagues)
- Associated with better therapeutic alliance as either therapist or client
- **Uniquely predicts** third-party recompensation (giving money to victims of unfairness)
- **Does not predict** adherence to abstract fairness norms (unlike Politeness)

**Creative achievement link (established)**:
- Combined with Enthusiasm, predicts creative achievement in the arts
- Effect mediated by emotional engagement and affective sensitivity

**Clinical associations**:
- Higher scores associated with better treatment outcomes (r = .20 for alliance)
- Very high Compassion may risk overextension and burnout in helping roles
- Associated with political liberalism

**Interpretation template for high Compassion (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Compassion score indicates you readily feel what others are feeling and are naturally motivated to help. This emotional attunement is valuable in relationships and helping professions but may sometimes leave you carrying others' emotional burdens. Developing boundaries—while maintaining your empathic nature—can help you sustain this capacity without depleting yourself."

---

### Politeness: Respect for others and impulse suppression

**What high Politeness means for behavior**

High scorers consider others' needs, respect social norms and authority, and suppress aggressive or rude impulses. The mechanism involves **top-down prefrontal control** suppressing exploitative or belligerent impulses—a more cognitive/rational process than Compassion's emotional response.

**Behavioral correlates for high Politeness (above 75th percentile)**:
- Deference to authority and social conventions
- Conflict avoidance and diplomatic communication
- Suppression of self-serving impulses when they would harm others
- Respect for boundaries and social propriety
- Avoidance of imposing will on others

**Career and workplace outcomes**:
- Optimal for diplomacy, customer service, mediation roles
- **Uniquely predicts** adherence to fairness norms in economic games (dictator game allocations)
- Reduces conflict escalation in teams
- May struggle in roles requiring confrontation or assertive negotiation

**Distinctive finding**: Compassion and Politeness show **opposite** correlations with political conservatism—Compassion negatively associated, Politeness positively associated. This reflects the warmth-versus-restraint distinction.

**Clinical associations**:
- Low Politeness + Low Compassion: Antagonism factor (NPD, ASPD risk)
- High Politeness patients: Easier therapeutic alliance formation
- Very high Politeness: May have difficulty asserting own needs

**Interpretation template for high Politeness (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Politeness score suggests you naturally consider others' perspectives and maintain respect for social boundaries. You likely avoid confrontation and prefer diplomatic approaches. While this creates harmony, ensure you're also able to advocate for your own needs when necessary—extreme politeness can sometimes mean your voice isn't heard."

---

### Interpreting Compassion versus Politeness asymmetries

**High Compassion + Low Politeness**:
- Emotionally caring but may be confrontational
- Challenges authority or breaks rules for prosocial reasons
- Associated with political liberalism
- May be a passionate advocate who ruffles feathers

**High Politeness + Low Compassion**:
- Follows rules and respects conventions without emotional warmth
- More "cold" prosociality based on duty rather than feeling
- Associated with political conservatism
- May appear proper but emotionally distant

---

## CONSCIENTIOUSNESS DOMAIN

### Industriousness: Achievement striving and self-discipline

**What high Industriousness means for behavior**

High scorers work hard, set and pursue goals effectively, maintain focus despite distractions, and finish what they start. The mechanism involves **prioritization of non-immediate goals** and keeping behavior on track, associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function.

**Behavioral correlates for high Industriousness (above 75th percentile)**:
- Self-starting on tasks without external prompting
- Sustained effort on long-term projects
- Resistance to distraction
- Goal-setting and follow-through
- Described as ambitious, hard-working, resourceful

**Academic outcomes (well-established)**:
- **Industriousness predicts GPA**; Orderliness does NOT
- Shows stronger prediction than overall Conscientiousness for academic achievement
- Forms achievement cluster with Intellect and Assertiveness

**Career outcomes (well-established)**:
- Strongest aspect-level predictor of job performance across occupations
- ~25% lower mortality risk associated with Industriousness (controlling for demographics)
- Predicts career success and advancement
- Essential for entrepreneurship combined with low Volatility

**Health outcomes**:
- Linked to lower inflammatory markers (IL-6)
- Better health behaviors overall
- Conscientiousness is the best personality predictor of longevity after intelligence

**Well-being finding (established)**:
- Industriousness semipartial correlation with well-being: sr = .55
- Orderliness semipartial correlation: sr = -.14
- Domain score would obscure this dramatic difference

**Interpretation template for high Industriousness (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Industriousness score suggests you're effective at pursuing goals, staying focused, and completing what you start. This drive is strongly associated with academic and career success. Be aware that very high scorers sometimes risk workaholism—ensure your achievement motivation includes goals beyond work, such as relationships and personal well-being."

---

### Orderliness: Organization, perfectionism, and rule-following

**What high Orderliness means for behavior**

High scorers prefer tidiness, organization, and structure; follow rules and schedules; want things "just right"; and are detail-oriented. The mechanism involves **avoiding entropy** by following rules set by self or others.

**Behavioral correlates for high Orderliness (above 75th percentile)**:
- Organized physical and digital environments
- Adherence to schedules and routines
- Attention to details and precision
- Discomfort with disorder or ambiguity
- Rule-following and respect for procedures

**Academic and work outcomes**:
- Does NOT independently correlate with GPA
- Predicts reliability and deadline adherence
- **Negatively correlated with creativity**—groups with only highly conscientious members struggle with open-ended problems
- Optimal for operations, quality control, administration, accounting

**Critical suppressor effect (well-established)**:
When controlling for Industriousness, Orderliness shows a **positive** correlation with Neuroticism (partial r = .20-.24). This reflects the perfectionism-anxiety link that domain-level measurement obscures. High Orderliness without matching Industriousness may indicate perfectionism without productivity.

**Clinical associations**:
- Very high Orderliness: OCPD spectrum, rigid perfectionism
- Maps to PID-5 Rigid Perfectionism facet
- High Orderliness patients may respond better to IPT than CBT

**Interpretation template for high Orderliness (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Orderliness score indicates a preference for structure, organization, and getting things 'just right.' This attention to detail is valuable in many contexts. However, when Orderliness is high relative to Industriousness, there's a risk of perfectionism becoming paralyzing—spending so much energy on organizing and perfecting that larger goals suffer. Focus on 'good enough' completion rather than perfect preparation."

---

### Interpreting Industriousness versus Orderliness asymmetries

**High Industriousness + Low Orderliness**:
- Achievement-driven but flexible and unstructured
- Gets things done without rigid organization
- Strongest predictor of job performance and academic success
- Slightly protective against Neuroticism

**High Orderliness + Low Industriousness (uncommon but notable)**:
- Organized environment but struggles with sustained effort
- May have tidy desk but incomplete projects
- Perfectionism without productivity
- **Red flag**: May indicate anxiety-driven organization rather than achievement orientation
- Explore barriers to sustained effort; consider ADHD screening if pattern is pervasive

---

## EXTRAVERSION DOMAIN

### Enthusiasm: Positive emotion and sociability

**What high Enthusiasm means for behavior**

High scorers enjoy others' company, experience frequent positive emotions, are warm in interactions, and make friends easily. The mechanism involves **consummatory reward sensitivity**—enjoyment of actual or imagined goal attainment ("liking"), linked to endogenous opioid systems.

**Behavioral correlates for high Enthusiasm (above 75th percentile)**:
- Frequent smiling, laughter, and expressions of positive emotion
- Ease in forming new friendships
- Warmth and approachability in social interactions
- Energy in social settings
- Openly expressed enjoyment of activities and relationships

**Career outcomes**:
- Contributes to person-oriented leadership behaviors (transformational leadership)
- Optimal for marketing, hospitality, teaching, team-based roles
- Strong positive effect on job satisfaction
- Combined with Compassion: predicts creative achievement in arts

**Well-being (well-established)**:
- Enthusiasm semipartial correlation: sr = .41
- Assertiveness semipartial correlation: sr = .14
- Enthusiasm drives Extraversion's well-being link

**Clinical associations**:
- Low Enthusiasm: Maps to PID-5 Anhedonia, Social Withdrawal, Restricted Affectivity
- Low Enthusiasm + High Withdrawal: Strongest negative well-being profile, target for clinical intervention
- Associated with hedonic reward system dysfunction in depression

**Interpretation template for high Enthusiasm (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Enthusiasm score suggests you experience positive emotions readily and find energy in social interactions. This warmth and positivity are assets in relationships and roles involving people. Research links Enthusiasm strongly to well-being, so this trait likely contributes to your overall life satisfaction."

---

### Assertiveness: Dominance, agency, and drive

**What high Assertiveness means for behavior**

High scorers take charge, speak up in groups, express opinions confidently, and are comfortable in leadership roles. The mechanism involves **incentive reward sensitivity**—drive toward goals ("wanting"), linked to dopaminergic systems.

**Behavioral correlates for high Assertiveness (above 75th percentile)**:
- Taking charge in group situations
- Speaking first and confidently expressing views
- Comfort with leadership and decision-making
- Strong sense of personal agency and potency
- Directness in communication

**Leadership outcomes (well-established)**:
- Primary driver of leadership emergence—more predictive than overall Extraversion
- Meta-analytic evidence: "Main driver behind associations between extraversion, transformational leadership, and performance"
- Forms achievement cluster with Intellect and Industriousness

**Critical curvilinear effect (established)**:
Excessive Assertiveness has **adverse social outcomes**. Research by Ames and Flynn shows moderate Assertiveness is optimal for leadership effectiveness. Ambiverts outperform extreme extraverts in sales—"assertive enough to close, but capable of listening."

**Clinical associations**:
- High Assertiveness + Low Compassion + Low Politeness: Dark Triad pattern (narcissism, Machiavellianism)
- High Assertiveness + High Volatility: Elevated hypomania risk
- Low Assertiveness: Maps to PID-5 Submissiveness; associated with social anxiety

**Interpretation template for high Assertiveness (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Assertiveness score indicates comfort with leadership, speaking up, and pursuing goals confidently. This drive is associated with career advancement and leadership emergence. However, research shows very high Assertiveness can have social costs—others may perceive you as domineering. The most effective leaders combine Assertiveness with listening skills and concern for others' perspectives."

---

### Interpreting Enthusiasm versus Assertiveness asymmetries

**High Enthusiasm + Low Assertiveness**:
- Sociable and warm but not dominant
- Strong positive relationships
- Higher subjective happiness
- May defer to others' leadership
- Not associated with hypomania risk

**High Assertiveness + Low Enthusiasm**:
- Socially dominant but not warm
- High autonomy and independence
- Associated with hypomania risk when combined with high Volatility
- May achieve status but lower subjective well-being
- Leadership emergence without affiliative warmth

---

## OPENNESS/INTELLECT DOMAIN

### Intellect: Engagement with abstract ideas

**What high Intellect means for behavior**

High scorers engage readily with abstract and semantic information, show quick comprehension and reasoning ability, and enjoy complex problems. The mechanism involves **detection of logical or causal patterns** in abstract information, associated with working memory capacity and prefrontal dopamine.

**Behavioral correlates for high Intellect (above 75th percentile)**:
- Quick to understand complex concepts
- Enjoyment of philosophical and theoretical discussions
- Comfort with abstraction and complexity
- Analytical thinking and logical reasoning
- Interest in ideas for their own sake

**Cognitive and academic outcomes (well-established)**:
- Intellect (not Openness) correlates with IQ, working memory accuracy, and faster reaction times
- Intellectual curiosity is the "third pillar" of academic performance after IQ and Conscientiousness
- **Predicts creative achievement in sciences** (not arts)—effect holds controlling for g and divergent thinking

**Critical double dissociation (established)**:
- Intellect predicts working memory but not implicit learning
- Openness predicts implicit learning but not working memory
- Intellect predicts science creativity; Openness predicts arts creativity

**Career outcomes**:
- Optimal for research, strategy, law, engineering, complex analysis
- Openness/Intellect is a stronger predictor of job performance than Conscientiousness for highly complex jobs
- Forms achievement cluster with Industriousness and Assertiveness

**Clinical associations**:
- **Negatively** associated with psychosis-proneness—may be protective
- High Intellect provides critical evaluation capacity that prevents false pattern detection

**Interpretation template for high Intellect (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Intellect score indicates strong engagement with abstract ideas, quick comprehension, and enjoyment of complex problem-solving. This is associated with scientific creativity and success in intellectually demanding fields. Research shows Intellect specifically—not just Openness in general—predicts achievement in science and analytical domains."

---

### Openness: Aesthetic and experiential engagement

**What high Openness means for behavior**

High scorers engage deeply with sensory and perceptual information, have strong aesthetic interests, vivid imagination, and fantasy-proneness. The mechanism involves **detection of spatial and temporal correlational patterns** in sensory/perceptual information, associated with implicit learning and absorption experiences.

**Behavioral correlates for high Openness (above 75th percentile)**:
- Deep appreciation of beauty in nature and art
- Vivid imagination and fantasy life
- Absorption in aesthetic experiences (music, visual art)
- Emotional engagement with creative works
- Sensitivity to sensory patterns others miss

**Creative outcomes (well-established)**:
- **Predicts creative achievement in arts** (not sciences)
- Openness correlates r = .39 with Creative Achievement Questionnaire arts composite
- Effect independent of other Big Five traits

**Critical clinical finding (established)**:
Openness (not Intellect) is associated with **psychosis-proneness and apophenia**—the tendency to detect patterns where none exist. This explains the "madness-genius paradox": high Openness increases both creative insight and risk for psychotic-like experiences. High Intellect may provide protection through critical evaluation.

**Clinical associations**:
- Maps to PID-5 Perceptual Dysregulation, Unusual Beliefs, Eccentricity
- Very high Openness without matching Intellect: elevated psychosis-proneness
- Associated with substance experimentation

**Interpretation template for high Openness (85th+ percentile)**:
"Your high Openness score suggests strong aesthetic sensitivity, imagination, and engagement with experiential and creative domains. This is associated with artistic creativity and appreciation for novel experiences. Note that very high Openness is sometimes associated with unusual perceptual experiences—this is not necessarily problematic unless it creates distress or impairment."

---

### Interpreting Intellect versus Openness asymmetries

**High Intellect (92nd percentile) + Moderate Openness (56th percentile)**:
"Your profile shows strong interest in abstract ideas, logical analysis, and intellectual engagement, while your aesthetic sensitivity and creative imagination fall in the typical range. This pattern suggests you may be drawn to analytical and theoretical pursuits more than artistic or experiential exploration. You likely enjoy complex problem-solving and philosophical discussions while being somewhat more conventional in approach to art and novel experiences."

**High Openness + Low Intellect**:
- Aesthetic, imaginative, fantasy-prone
- Creative in arts but not sciences
- Higher absorption and sensitivity to perceptual patterns
- **Elevated risk for psychosis-proneness/apophenia**
- May experience more unusual perceptual experiences

**High Intellect + Low Openness**:
- Analytical/scientific without aesthetic engagement
- Strong logical reasoning, intellectual confidence
- Lower creative achievement in arts
- Conventional in approach to experience
- Associated with faster reaction times, better working memory

---

- Screen for schizotypal features

### Protective and resilient patterns

**Optimal well-being profile**:
High Enthusiasm + Low Withdrawal + High Industriousness
- Maps to "Role Model" cluster in typology research
- Highest well-being across dimensions

**Achievement pattern**:
High Intellect + High Industriousness + High Assertiveness
- Dopamine-linked achievement cluster
- Highest accomplishment scores
- Optimal for demanding careers

### Profile typologies from cluster research

Research on 1.5+ million participants identifies four robust personality types:

1. **Average** (largest group): High N, high E, low O, moderate A and C
2. **Self-centered**: High E, medium N, low O/A/C—more common in young men
3. **Reserved**: Low N, low O, moderate others
4. **Role Model**: Low N, high O/A/C/E—more common in women over 40

## INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES FOR PRACTITIONERS

### Percentile range communication framework

| Range | Label | Template Language |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1st-10th | Very Low | "Your score places you among the lowest 10%, indicating a distinctive pattern where you tend to..." |
| 10th-25th | Low | "You score lower than about 75-90% of people, suggesting a tendency toward..." |
| 25th-40th | Low-Average | "Your score falls in the low-average range, meaning..." |
| 40th-60th | Average | "Your score is close to the population average, near the middle of the distribution..." |
| 60th-75th | Moderately High | "You score higher than 60-75% of people, indicating a tendency toward..." |
| 75th-90th | High | "Your score places you in the top quarter, suggesting a strong tendency toward..." |
| 90th-99th | Very High | "Your score places you in the top 10%, indicating an unusually strong expression of..." |

### Gender norms to consider

Gender differences are **more pervasive at aspect level** than domain level:
- Women score higher on: Compassion (d = 0.45), Withdrawal (d = 0.40), Politeness (d = 0.36), Volatility (d = 0.30)
- Men score higher on: Intellect (d = -0.22), Assertiveness (d = -0.09)

Despite significant mean differences, distributions show substantial overlap. Communicate this: "Even for traits showing gender differences, many men score higher than many women and vice versa."

### When to emphasize aspect-level interpretation

**Always interpret at aspect level when**:
- Predicting specific outcomes (creativity type, academic versus arts achievement)
- Assessing psychopathology risk (Withdrawal versus Volatility distinguish internalizing from externalizing)
- Aspects differ by more than 1 standard deviation within domain
- Clinical assessment requiring treatment targets

**Domain level sufficient when**:
- Broad screening purposes
- Limited assessment time
- General adjustment prediction

### Reliability considerations for difference scores

- Aspect correlations within domains: r = .51-.64
- Only interpret aspect differences exceeding 1 standard deviation
- Test-retest reliability (2-4 weeks): r = .82-.86
- Internal consistency: α = .80-.93 for aspects

### Dos and don'ts for score communication

**DO**:
- Present scores as tendencies and probabilities
- Use ranges: "somewhere between the 60th and 75th percentile"
- Balance advantages and challenges of each score
- Contextualize: "In situations requiring X, your tendency toward Y might..."
- Invite dialogue: "Does this description resonate?"
- Emphasize change potential: "Traits can develop over time"

**DON'T**:
- Use deterministic language: "You ARE an X" or "You will always..."
- Pathologize normal variation: Low Extraversion ≠ disorder
- Over-interpret small differences: 10 percentile points may not be meaningful
- Present as permanent

---

## CLINICAL AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS

### Treatment modality matching by aspect profile

**CBT more effective for**:
- High Avoidant traits (Withdrawal + low Assertiveness)
- Comorbid personality symptoms
- Depression with anxiety features

**IPT more effective for**:
- High OCPD traits (Orderliness)
- Higher depression severity
- Patients without personality disorders

**DBT indicated for**:

- Higher Extraversion
- Higher Openness (alliance maintenance)

**Red flags for treatment engagement**:
- Very low Agreeableness: High dropout risk—prioritize motivational enhancement
- Very high Neuroticism: May overwhelm with distress—pace treatment
- Very low Conscientiousness: Compliance issues—structure sessions

### DSM-5 personality disorder aspect profiles

| Disorder | Key Aspects | Pattern |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Borderline | Very high Volatility + high Withdrawal | Emotional dysregulation + depression/anxiety |
